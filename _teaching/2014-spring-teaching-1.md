I taught English as Second Language (ESL) in China for three years at the college/adult level. And while I was there I took Chinese language courses at Beijing Radio and Television University in Beijing. Most of my work was engaging students in the *practice* of conversational english. The following are some photographs and summaries of the Universities and venues I taught at.
