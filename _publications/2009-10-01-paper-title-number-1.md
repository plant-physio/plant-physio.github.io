This paper demonstrates how affordable hobby-level electronics supplies can be used to discover light-sensitive mutant plant phenotypes and genotypes. My contribution was building and coding the very simple script of the microcontroller. This is a fun example of how hobby electronics integrated into plant physiology and genetics research.
