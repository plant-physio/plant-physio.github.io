This goes way back to when I was an undergraduate student. I applied for undergraduate research funding at the University of Illinois and received enough to perform flow cytometry to look at the genome sizes of three species in the *Miscanthus* genus. 

*M. sinensis* and *M. sacchariflorus* were believed to have crossed to make a sterile triploid *M. x giganteus*. Their mean genome sizes support that hypothesis. This was a fun approach to looking at the big-picture look at the evolution of *M. x g* before detailed genetic and genomic information was known.
