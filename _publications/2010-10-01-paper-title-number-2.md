In this first-author paper I created the first genetic map of prairie cord grass, a candidate C4 bioenergy crop. The interesting twist is that prairie cord grass is a tetraploid; it has 4 gopies of its genome. Before this we did not know if it used diploid inheritance of genes or polysomic inheritance. We determined that it seems to function like a diploid which is more amenable to making crosses and breeding this species. We used genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) to generate thousands of genetic markers. Another twist of this paper was that we used the incomplete tef genome scaffolds to bridge to the sorghum genome and this gave a view of how similar the chromosome structures prairie cordgrass are to sorghum. This was a fantastic masters project because I learned a full spectrum of scientific skills like greenhouse hybridization/crossing, field study design, DNA extraction, GBS wet lab techniques as well as the GBS data production pipeline, and statistical genetic mapping.
